# Minesweeper Clone project

This repository contains a personal project I worked on in 2021, where I
recreated the game Minesweeper from scratch. The implementation ended up being
done in two separate parts:

[CLI implementation](minesweeper): This implementation was done in
Java and contains a working version of the game that can be played from the
command line.

[GUI implementation](<Minesweeper Clone>): After the first implementation was
finished, I decided to try rewriting this project in C#, since I wanted to
learn the language. To add to the project, I also decided to make this version
a GUI-based version, giving it a similar look to the classic game.
